# Simple Bungee Jumping Model

# Problem Statement

  A bungee jumper wants to have a “great ride,” getting close to the ground
without hitting it. Suppose the distance of the jumping bridge above a gorge
is 80 m and the length of the cord is 30 m. Determine the most appropriate
whole number spring constants for jumpers of masses 60 kg, 70 kg, and 80 kg. Employ comparison graphs.

# Solution
# Program Bungee Jumping
1. This program initially sets a large spring constant (k) so that the displacement is small
2. The program then reduces its spring constant looping
3. Then the spring constant that is closest but does not exceed the bridge height (80 m) is displayed
4. The maximum length is 80 m minus the height of the person jumping
5. Also displayed is a graph of the rope length and velocity using the appropriate spring constant
